# Project-Euler
working project Euler in python, maybe other languages, for practice, aka s**ts and giggles.  I think it'll help me keep my "chops" as the musicians say, for both numerical 
manipulation as well as for coding. Problems taken from PROJECTEULER.NET

Please feel free to use my code, and to offer tips or pointers.  Honest feedback of any kind is truly appreciated.
